====

Grav is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible**, file-based Web-platform.  There is **Zero** installation required.  Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running.  It follows similar principals to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most.

The underlying architecture of Grav has been designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies, where applicable, to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Twig Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/): for powerful control of the user interface
* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [YAML](http://yaml.org): for simple configuration
* [Doctrine Cache](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/2.0.x/reference/caching.html): layer for incredible performance
